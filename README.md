# Kart-Assessment-Server
This Java program is designed to use multiple server-client connections to synchronize an enviroment between clients.
The implementation worked well, utilitising the parallel development of the enviroment in order to make updateing of changes as seemless as possible.
The client counterpart can be found in this repo: https://github.com/MegaDarken/Kart-Assessment
